This dataset was received from a bank located in the United States. 
In addition to banking services, this bank also provides car insurance services. 
Bank organizes marketing companies to attract new customers regularly. 
The bank has data on potential customers and bank consultants call them to provide 
and advertise affordable car insurance options.

### Task: 
We have data on 4,000 customers who were contacted during the last 
marketing campaign and for whom the results of the campaign 
are known (whether the customer bought insurance or not). 
We should predict for 1000 customers contracted during the current campaign 
whether they will buy car insurance or not.
